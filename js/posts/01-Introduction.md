My name is Stan Le. Before we get started, I'm just going to answer a few questions:

 * Yes, that's my real name, just one 'e'.
 * Yes, I realize that my first and last name make up a first name.
 * No, it's not Stanley Le. 
 * Yes, my parents have a sick sense of the humor.
 * No, I had no idea Marvel Studios had an editor in chief by the same name!

Now that that's out of the way, I'd like tell you a bit about myself that you might not be able to glean from just my name. For ease of reading, and because I'll rant plenty in my actual posts, I'm just going to make everything into lists. Hooray for lists!

Things I like:
 * Cats
 * Trivia
 * History
 * JavaScript
 * Video Games
 * Traveling
 * Making Lists
 * New Music
 * Learning stuff

Things I don't like:
 * Form Validation
 * Country Music
 * Airport Customs
 * People claiming video games make kids more violent. (That's like blaming knives for people getting stabbed)
 * My wireless router
 * 100+ degree weather (35 for the rest of the world)

Things I'm going to try to do with this blog:
 * Talk about programming
 * Talk about new technology
 * Talk about myself and all the shenanigans I find myself in
 * Entertain you

Thanks for reading! I hope you'll enjoy your stay.
